## Pyenv - How to Use

-   Check what version of python you have installed
    `pyenv versions`

-   This is how you install a new version of python
    `pyenv install 3.11.0`

-   This is a way to create a new virtual environment
    `pyenv virtualenv 3.11.0 project-name`

-   Then navigate to the project folder
    `cd your-project`

-   This will activate the virtual environment within the directory of your project
    `pyenv local project-name`

-   To check all your environments
    `pyenv virtualenvs`
