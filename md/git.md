# Move like Git Gods

Some common git commands I confuse. Don't expect `git add` or `git commit` here. By no means, it's exhaustive, but rather a refernce for myself for `concepts` I have had to look up more than once. 

## Merge
### FF Merge
### 3-Way Merge

- merge commit

## Rebase
### Interactive Rebase
- Pick
- Reword
- Squash

Not part of interactive rebase, but somewhat similar: 
- Amend
- Revert
### Rebase with main 

## Reset
## Stash
## Cherry Pick

## Common commands
- `git log --oneline --graph` 
- `git branch -d <branch-name>` 
- `git checkout <branch-name>`
